# Partnership-Management

## Start with Why?

Long term friends play long term games together. When we are able to provide for ourselves and a group, we feel a deeper fulfillment in life. Four friends wish to share a property that creates an environment outside their home and workplace that improves their life by giving them a space to rendevous anytime.

Why code an application to manage the partnership? 
- Humans act with emotion and financial decisions are best emotionless
- The system can be iteratively improved
- Logic/Intution can explain decisions regarding the partnership
- Risk will be minimized via an LLC


## Vision - What will the program do?





The program will automate the reporting required for a partnership to operate. It will contain the General Ledger where all transactions are shown and can be updated by users. Each transaction is associated with a UserID. 

Furthermore it will generate an HTML page that'll render a quarterly statement type document in real time as well as create and maintain a EOD report repository.

An investments section will be another link on the application that will render a Python and Flask/HTML page showing investment performance, expected holding period, and reasoning for each investment.

The program will have preset signals of when to turn cash into an investment such as to not move with market sentiment


### 






We need to see the credits and debits of the dollars used as well as show the assets under management. 

This repository will hold a HTML file that displays real time pages that look like quarterly reports. 

CSS and SASS will be used to style the HTML 

Python, JavaScript, Django, Flask, and SQL will be used to create the front-end, back-end, and database.
